# Calculator
This code library can parse expressions with variables and evaluate them relative to given values.

Operations:  
Binary:  
`+ - * /`  
`min`  
`max`  
Unary:  
`-`  
`count` (counts 1 in binary interpretation)  

In `src/expression/Main.java` there is an example of using parser + evaluate mechanism.
